# JavaScript Racer

## Chicken Run!

### Synopsis - GA Project Requirements

- Make a racer game that two players can play (on one keyboard) by each pressing a key to move their player across the board
- When one player gets their player to the other side, the game is over
- Display the winner of the race!
- Use only vanilla JavaScript. No jQuery!

**Bonus:**
- Use images to create a fun background and players
- Score each game based on the time it took to complete and by how much time they beat the opposing player
- Display the time it took for the player to complete the race
- Make a 'Best of 3' tournament, and display the winner of the tournament
- Keep track of best times/ high scores across page refreshes using localStorage
- Add animations
- Have players do something other than simply pressing a key to move their player, for example, make them type words, or solve simple math problems
