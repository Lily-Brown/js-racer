# JavaScript Racer

## Chicken Run!

### Synopsis

First weekend project at GA. As per the guidelines, this application had to meet these requirements:

- Make a racer game that two players can play (on one keyboard) by each pressing a key to move their player across the board
- When one player gets their player to the other side, the game is over
- Display the winner of the race!
- Use only vanilla JavaScript. No jQuery!

I also accomplished the following stretch goals: 

- Use images to create a fun background and players
- Score each game based on the time it took to complete and by how much time they beat the opposing player
- Display the time it took for the player to complete the race
